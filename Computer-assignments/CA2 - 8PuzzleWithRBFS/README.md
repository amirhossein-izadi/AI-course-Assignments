# RBFS Algorithm for Puzzle 8

This assignment focuses on solving the Puzzle 8 game using the RBFS (Recursive Best-First Search) algorithm. The RBFS algorithm is an informed search algorithm that explores the search space by evaluating nodes based on a heuristic function.

## Puzzle 8 Problem

The Puzzle 8 problem involves a 3x3 grid with eight numbered tiles (numbered from 1 to 8) and one empty tile. The goal is to reach the final state where the tiles are arranged in ascending order from 1 to 8.
