# Football Events Analysis

This assignment focuses on analyzing football event data using pandas, numpy, and data visualization libraries. The assignment covers various tasks such as data import, cleaning, exploration, and visualization. It also includes performance comparison between numpy built-in functions and pure Python functions.

The assignment consists of the following questions:

1. Import the datasets and gain insights about the data.
2. Delete the rows without detailed event data.
3. Extract the top most eventful games.
4. Find the distribution of the time each goal is scored.
5. Analyze shot outcomes for four quarters of a game.
6. Calculate the mean of events in different years.
7. Sort the leagues by the average of scores in a season.
8. Find the games where the away team won by 3 or more goal difference.
9. Find the two players with the most events together.
10. Sort the players with the most goals + assists.
11. Compare the performance of numpy built-in functions and pure Python functions.

Each question is accompanied by code snippets and explanations.
